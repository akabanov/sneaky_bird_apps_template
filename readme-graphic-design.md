### Quick Guide

Here's a simple process to create your app icon:

1. Choose an AI icon generator
2. Describe your desired icon, including style, colors, and any specific elements
3. Generate multiple options using the AI tool
4. Select the best-generated icon
5. Use the platform's built-in editor or export to a tool like Photopea for fine-tuning
6. Ensure your icon looks good at various sizes, as it will be displayed differently across devices, particularly tiny
   ones like 29x29px
7. Export your icon in the required formats and sizes for your target platforms (iOS, Android, etc.)

### Important Tips

* Keep it simple - a complex icon will look cluttered at small sizes
* Test your icon at multiple sizes (particularly tiny ones like 29x29px)
* Ensure good contrast so it's visible on both light and dark backgrounds
* Avoid text unless absolutely necessary
* Consider your competition's icons to stand out while fitting the category
