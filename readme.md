# New Flutter project template

This is a template for the upcoming https://sneakybird.app applications.

It's currently in its very early stages of development.

I'm crafting this project for personal use with two objectives in mind:

- To be able to start new Flutter projects with all needed integrations ready as quickly as possible
- Learn the production and maintenance process end-to-end

This template is available [UNLICENSED](LICENSE).

The snippets and the setup script are designed for Ubuntu 24.04.
While some of these many may work in other environments, others may require tweaking.

Also, the instructions and the setup script assume the project is hosted on GitHub.
