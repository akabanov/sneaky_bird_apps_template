All new features, functionality, and product changes must be described with specificity in the Notes for Review 

If your app includes in-app purchases, make sure your app description, screenshots, and previews clearly indicate whether any featured items, levels, subscriptions, etc. require additional purchases.

assign keywords that accurately describe your app, and don’t try to pack any of your metadata with trademarked terms, popular app names, pricing information, or other irrelevant phrases just to game the system

Metadata such as app names, subtitles, screenshots, and previews should not include prices, terms, or descriptions that are not specific to the metadata type.

subtitles should not include inappropriate content, reference other apps, or make unverifiable product claims

don’t include names, icons, or imagery of other mobile platforms or alternative app marketplaces in your app or metadata
