# What's not to forget when adding flavours

Shorebird integration looks for flavours, so they must be configured before Shorebird.

Flavour-specific app icons are configured in `flutter_launcher_icons-<flavor>.yaml` files.
[See the icon package docs](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_launcher_icons#flavor-support).
